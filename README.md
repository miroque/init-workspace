# Init-workspace

I need 2 layers, firstone is cmd - ordinary bat file to start PowerShell.
Main work will be done by PowerShell script.

So originaly this work can be done in Powershell only.
CMD bat file only starts Powershell in admin priveleges and enabels run local script files.

In next future, this algorithm I want rewrite to bash script,
that will do the same work on linux mashines.
